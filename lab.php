                            Electrical theory is the study of the basic principles of electricity, such as magnetism, Ohm's law, and circuit properties. It also involves understanding how electricity functions in electronic devices and systems.

         <p style="text-align:justify;">The Electrical as well as Electronics becomes the need of day to day life which has made the life simple & comfortable. Thus the Electrical & Electronics engineering branch has been inducted by BTEUP Lucknow to facilitate the society with budding engineer having knowledge of both the streams. The department is producing qualified professionals to face the challenge in the emerging areas of electrical engineering and electronics engineering. The course curriculum produce qualified professionals equipped to face the challenges of career. This department has qualified and experienced faculty both in traditional & technical field who impart instructions and training to the students effectively. The theoretical knowledge is further supplemented by well equipped laboratories like electrical engineering lab, electrical machines lab, measurement lab, numerical technique lab, electrical simulation lab and electrical drives lab etc. In Government Polytechnic Phulpur Azamgarh we also provide advancement in electrical systems with the help of neural network and fuzzy logic and softwares like MATLAB, ETAP, PSPICE etc. The lab facilities and the Infrastructure are regularly upgraded and are well supported by the institute and the industry.</p>

    <h4>Physics Lab</h4>
         <img src="image/physics2.jpg" alt="Physics Lab" style="height:60vh;width:100%"/><br>
         <p style="text-align:justify;">A major problem is: how does one quantify data so that experiments can adequately be
compared? Physicists try to apply a rigorous method of error analysis, and then compare results
with respect to the inherent experimental errors. If two experiments produce results that are the
same to within experimental error, then we say that the experiments have validated each other.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Safety in the laboratory is very important. The experiments performed in the laboratory are
designed to be as safe as possible, but caution is always advised concerning the use of the
equipment. When you arrive at the start of each class meeting, it is very important that you
do not touch or turn on the laboratory equipment until it has been explained by the
professor and permission has been granted to get started. The equipment for the labs are set
up for you in advance, so resist the urge to play with the equipment when you arrive, as you may
hurt yourself or others, or damage the equipment.
