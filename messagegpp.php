<h4>About PPP Government Polytechnic Colleges</h4><br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are engineers, but mid-level requirement of the industry is not properly met. There is a dearth of skilled labour. The quality of existing Government polytechnics is also not very good. It will be a win-win situation for students and the industry. The objective of the PPP Government model is to bring the Private Sector Partners (PSP) onboard to operate and maintain the identified institutes focusing on imparting quality trainings with state-of-the-art infrastructure.The Government Mission’s basic objective is to create a trained Skilled Manpower of at least 100 million persons by 2030. Hence the Ministry Technical Education, Government of Uttar Pradesh is into the implementation of scheme for setting up new Polytechnics under PPP modeTechnical Education is instrumental in making a remarkable contribution to economicgrowth of the Developing Countries by way of suitable manpower productionaccording to the needs of the Industry, Society and the Global World as a whole. Toproduce contemporary skilled manpower & technocrats suited to the present era ofscience and technology is the need of the hour. Polytechnic education has thereforeresponded to the challenges of industrialization for self-reliance, as well as meetinginternational demands.The aim of the PPP Government polytechnic education is to create a pool of skill-based manpower tosupport shop floor and field operations as a middle level link between techniciansand engineers. The pass-outs of Diploma level Institutions in Engineering &Technology play an important role in managing shop-floor operations. It is further anestablished fact that small & medium Industry prefer to employ Diploma Holdersbecause of their special skills in interpreting engineering, drawings, estimating,costing, billing, supervision, measurement, testing, repair & maintenance etc </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;">The Government Mission’s basic objective is to create a trained Skilled Manpower ofat least 500 million persons by 2030. It gives me immense joy to see the Government Polytechnic Phoolpur First PPP Govt Polytechnic spreading its wings and taking steps towards redefining technical education in the state under PPP scheme. When we set up PPP mode in Government Polytechnic, our vision was to create a world class institution delivering quality technical education recognized by the industry, nationally and internationally. This is a challenge as well as an opportunity to do something innovative and futuristic for generations to come. The Government Polytechnic Phoolpur under PPP mode must focus on producing employable students who will take India forward. For this we must design and run courses in consonance with the industry requirements. We must enable and support the students to achieve excellence in whichever field they wish to pursue at the college. I strongly believe that GPA, Azamgarh will become a model for Technical education in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Government Polytechnic Phoolpur is aggremented 62.5% Seat (38 Seat)under Fully Governmented(JEECUP Code-4900) and 37.5 % Seat (22) under PPP category Self Financev Mode(JEECUP Code-4901) of Each Specilization.My heartiest wishes to the students who aspire to join the Government Polytechnic Phoolpur, I extend my full support to the Government Polytechnic Phoolpur team in taking the vision forward.</p></div>

            <p style="text-align:justify;">I am indeed delighted to present before you the first Government Polytechnic institute in Uttar Pradesh established under PPP model in the region it has been producing disciplined and competent engineers with sound technical knowledge who are full of confidence to become global pioneers of tomorrow. As we know, engineers play the most vital and important role in nation building. They are the one who create new inventions using best engineered technologies to make human life comfortable, secured and productive. Today in the era of privatisation and globalisation, we try to groom and nourish the technocrats in such a way that they are fully equipped to meet the global demand. In its early stage itself has shown the brightest amongst all the technical institutes of Uttar Pradesh region, and I congratulate Government Polytechnic Phoolpur team for his great success.
