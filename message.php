            <p style="text-align:justify;">The Government Mission’s basic objective is to create a trained Skilled Manpower ofat least 500 million persons by 2030. It gives me immense joy to see the Government Polytechnic Phoolpur First PPP Govt Polytechnic spreading its wings and taking steps towards redefining technical education in the state under PPP scheme. When we set up PPP mode in Government Polytechnic, our vision was to create a world class institution delivering quality technical education recognized by the industry, nationally and internationally. This is a challenge as well as an opportunity to do something innovative and futuristic for generations to come. The Government Polytechnic Phoolpur under PPP mode must focus on producing employable students who will take India forward. For this we must design and run courses in consonance with the industry requirements. We must enable and support the students to achieve excellence in whichever field they wish to pursue at the college. I strongly believe that GPA, Azamgarh will become a model for Technical education in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
